# Kochava Fraud API Library

This is a privately created library to aid in using the Kochava Fraud API.

Note that this library is not officially endorsed by Kochava, nor is the code created by Kochava. 
This is simply my library to help me interact with their API, described here:

Definitely a work in progress; will update readme as library becomes usable.
